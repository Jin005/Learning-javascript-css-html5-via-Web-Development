# Learning-javascript-css-html5-via-Web-Development

These are code I created following along the Web Development Bootcamp (Udemy, instructor: Colt Steele - https://www.udemy.com/course/the-web-developer-bootcamp/). This course is nothing to do with biology, but from here, an experimental biologist by training as me, got encouragement and capability to be able to code in any computer language. Because it shifts my mindset to be computational thinking.
